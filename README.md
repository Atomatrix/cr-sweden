# CRS-Bot [![Discord](https://discord.com/api/guilds/1045029146209820713/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/C8S55SQXGQ)
The CRS bot is a Discord bot specifically designed for the Clash Royale Sweden community server. Its primary function is to sync Clash Royale data with Discord roles, which enables players to showcase their in-game progress to other members of the community.

The bot uses a settings file to pick up variables that are different from server-to-server. In this repository, the settings have been wiped.
