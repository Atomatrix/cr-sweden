# CRS-Bot 
The CRS bot is a Discord bot specifically designed for the Clash Royale Sweden community server. Its primary function is to sync Clash Royale data with Discord roles, which enables players to showcase their in-game progress to other members of the community.

The bot uses a settings file to pick up variables that are different from server-to-server. In this repository, the settings have been wiped.
